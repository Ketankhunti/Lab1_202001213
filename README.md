                                            Identifying Functional and Non-Functional requiremets

Question 1 : Library Information System

Functional Requirements :

1) System must be able to authenticate user and should have functionality to verify user.
2) System must differentiate between users like students , other user , professor , librarian etc.
3) System should store book information like its author , title , book edition etc.
4) User should be able to show their profile information.
5) User should be able to see which books he/she has issued, what is due date, if they can reissue it.
6) User should be able to search for books.
7) Librarian must be able to add new books and remove books.
8) Librarian should get summary of users the end of the month like which are the books issued by which user , which users are returning books at time etc.
9) When user issue a book system should validate user.
10) System may recommand books to the user based on his/her previous readings.

Non-Functional Requirements : 

1) System must be able to securely store user credentials.
2) System must be in consistent state even after transactions failures .( power cut , network issue)
3) System should work efficiently when number of user increases.Scalability is important.
4) User Interface must be user friendly so that new users can not find it difficult.
5) System should work when slow network conditions are there.


Question 2 : 

Scope :

=> we are delivering mobile application that will be able to identify some of key sound events in our daily routines and acts as a solution for the peoples suffering from sound disablities.

Functional Requirements : 

1) App must have login feature for the users.
2) app must be able to tract sound (data) through its sensors and process it.
3) app must give output to the use very fast.
4) app should be able to alert user using notification , some sound or vibrations etc.
5) app should run at low network latency.
6) app's AI should be programmed well so that it can differentiate between different sounds.


Non-Functional Requirements : 

1) App must be scalable. it should run efficiently even when number of users grow large.
2) App should store user data securely.
3) User interface should be simple enough so that users with no technical background can use it without any difficulty.
4) Sensor should be reliable and track sound correctly.
5) AI must provide correct data (Instructiosns) to the user.
6) App must have very low fault rate because wrong information might be harmful to the user's life.
